- "included with all plans" images are not rel linked, so they are all broken on my system. You'll need to reformat the URL.
- You didn't use the Bootstrap container, so the page does not fill the full width of my page. Look at Bootstrap's Grid System to learn more.
- Never, ever, ever use tables (footer menu) that is what the Grid System is for. Tables are not responsive by default, but Bootstrap has the built in already.
